# Gcov (Source Code Coverage)

## Basics of Gcov and Gcovr

Source code coverage is data indicating the count and frequency of every program execution path that has been taken within a program's runtime. [Gcov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcov) is a GCC tool that, when used in concert with the compiler, can generate log files indicating the execution count of each line of a source file. The [Gcovr](https://gcovr.com/) tool is a utility for managing Gcov and generating summarized code coverage results.

Generally, using Gcov to compile and run programs on the host will undergo these steps:

1. Compile the source code using GCC with the `--coverage` option enabled. This will cause the compiler to generate a `.gcno` notes files during compilation. The notes files contain information to reconstruct execution path block graphs and map each block to source code line numbers. Each source file compiled with the `--coverage` option should have their own `.gcno` file of the same name (e.g., a `main.c` will generate a `main.gcno` when compiled).

2. Execute the program. During execution, the program should generate `.gcda` data files. These data files contain the counts of the number of times an execution path was taken. The program will generate a `.gcda` file for each source file compiled with the `--coverage` option (e.g., `main.c` will generate a `main.gcda`).

3. Gcov or Gcovr can be used to generate a code coverage based on the `.gcno`, `.gcda`, and source files. Gcov will generate a text-based coverage report for each source file in the form of a `.gcov` file, whilst Gcovr will generate a coverage report in HTML format.

## Gcov and Gcovr in ESP-IDF

Using Gcov in ESP-IDF is complicated due to the fact that the program is running remotely from the host (i.e., on the target). The code coverage data (i.e., the `.gcda` files) is initially stored on the target itself. OpenOCD is then used to dump the code coverage data from the target to the host via JTAG during runtime. Using Gcov in ESP-IDF can be split into the following steps.

1. [Setting Up a Project for Gcov](#setting-up-a-project-for-gcov)
2. [Dumping Code Coverage Data](#dumping-code-coverage-data)
3. [Generating Coverage Report](#generating-coverage-report)

## Setting Up a Project for Gcov

### Compiler Option

In order to obtain code coverage data in a project, one or more source files within the project must be compiled with the `--coverage` option. In ESP-IDF, this can be achieved at the component level or the individual source file level:

- To cause all source files in a component to be compiled with the `--coverage` option, you can add `target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE --coverage)` to the `CMakeLists.txt` file of the component.
- To cause a select number of source files (e.g., `source1.c` and `source2.c`) in the same component to be compiled with the `--coverage` option, you can add `set_source_files_properties(source1.c source2.c PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS --coverage)` to the `CMakeLists.txt` file of the component.

When a source file is compiled with the `--coverage` option (e.g., `gcov_example.c`), the compiler will generate the `gcov_example.gcno` file in the project's build directory.

### Project Configuration

Before building a project with source code coverage, make sure that the following project configuration options are enabled by running `idf.py menuconfig`.

- Enable the application tracing module by selecting `Trace Memory` for the `CONFIG_APPTRACE_DESTINATION1` option.
- Enable Gcov to the host via the `CONFIG_APPTRACE_GCOV_ENABLE`.

## Dumping Code Coverage Data

Once a project has been complied with the `--coverage` option and flashed onto the target, code coverage data will be stored internally on the target (i.e., in trace memory) whilst the application runs. The process of transferring code coverage data from the target to the host is known as dumping.

The dumping of coverage data is done via OpenOCD (see JTAG Debugging documentation on how to setup and run OpenOCD). A dump is triggered by issuing commands to OpenOCD, therefore a telnet session to OpenOCD must be opened to issue such commands (run `telnet localhost 4444`). Note that GDB could be used instead of telnet to issue commands to OpenOCD, however all commands issued from GDB will need to be prefixed as `mon <oocd_command>`.

When the target dumps code coverage data, the `.gcda` files are stored in the project's build directory. For example, if `gcov_example_main.c` of the `main` component is compiled with the `--coverage` option, then dumping the code coverage data would generate a `gcov_example_main.gcda` in `build/esp-idf/main/CMakeFiles/__idf_main.dir/gcov_example_main.c.gcda`. Note that the `.gcno` files produced during compilation are also placed in the same directory.

The dumping of code coverage data can be done multiple times throughout an application's lifetime. Each dump will simply update the `.gcda` file with the newest code coverage information. Code coverage data is accumulative, thus the newest data will contain the total execution count of each code path over the application's entire lifetime.

ESP-IDF supports two methods of dumping code coverage data form the target to the host:

* Instant Run-Time Dump
* Hard-coded Dump

### Instant Run-Time Dump

An Instant Run-Time Dump is triggered by calling the `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} gcov` OpenOCD command (via a telnet session). Once called, OpenOCD will immediately preempt the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}'s current state and execute a built-in ESP-IDF Gcov debug stub function. The debug stub function will handle the dumping of data to the host. Upon completion, the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will resume its current state.

### Hard-coded Dump

A Hard-coded Dump is triggered by the application itself by calling `esp_gcov_dump()` from somewhere within the application. When called, the application will halt and wait for OpenOCD to connect and retrieve the code coverage data. Once `esp_gcov_dump()` is called, the host must execute the `esp gcov dump` OpenOCD command (via a telnet session). The `esp gcov dump` command will cause OpenOCD to connect to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, retrieve the code coverage data, then disconnect from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, thus allowing the application to resume. Hard-coded Dumps can also be triggered multiple times throughout an application's lifetime.

Hard-coded dumps are useful if code coverage data is required at certain points of an application's lifetime by placing `esp_gcov_dump()` where necessary (e.g., after application initialization, during each iteration of an application's main loop).

GDB can be used to set a breakpoint on `esp_gcov_dump()`, then call `mon esp gcov dump` automatically via the use a `gdbinit` script (see Using GDB from JTAG debugging documentation).

The following GDB script will add a breakpoint at `esp_gcov_dump()`, then call the `mon esp gcov dump` OpenOCD command.

```
b esp_gcov_dump
commands
mon esp gcov dump
end
```

> **Note:** All OpenOCD commands should be invoked in GDB as: `mon <oocd_command>`.

## Generating Coverage Report

Once the code coverage data has been dumped, the `.gcno`, `.gcda` and the source files can be used to generate a code coverage report. A code coverage report is simply a report indicating the number of times each line in a source file has been executed.

Both Gcov and Gcovr can be used to generate code coverage reports. Gcov is provided along with the Xtensa toolchain, whilst Gcovr may need to be installed separately. For details on how to use Gcov or Gcovr, refer to [Gcov documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) and [Gcovr documentation](https://gcovr.com/).

### Adding Gcovr Build Target to Project

To make report generation more convenient, users can define additional build targets in their projects such that the report generation can be done with a single build command.

Add the following lines to the `CMakeLists.txt` file of your project.

```cmake
include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/gcov.cmake)
idf_create_coverage_report(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/coverage_report)
idf_clean_coverage_report(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/coverage_report)
```

The following commands can now be used:

* `cmake --build build/ --target gcovr-report` will generate an HTML coverage report in `$(BUILD_DIR_BASE)/coverage_report/html` directory.
* `cmake --build build/ --target cov-data-clean` will remove all coverage data files.
